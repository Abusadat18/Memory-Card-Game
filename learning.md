# My Learning via this project

- Justify self cannot be used in flexbox
- Whenever we import a file, the file first runs from the top before it is been exported
- Usage of object-fit property
- In many places Grid solves a problem way easier than flexbox
- Usage of event listeners in React, we pass the function (if without parameter) directly to onClick, but with parameters, we pass with a callback function.
